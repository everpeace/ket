# Contributing guideline for KET

I am looking forward to your contributions!!
If you find any bugs or troubles, please report them in the Issue!

## It needs an Issue?

In the case of bug fixes, you can create a PR without making an Issue.
The same applies to specification changes, if they provide compatibility for existing users.

However, if a major feature or an interface change, you should create an Issue. It needs to be discussed.
